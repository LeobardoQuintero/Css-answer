Question 1
CSS vs HTML: HTML structures content (like headings, paragraphs), while CSS styles and lays out this content, determining its visual presentation (colors, sizes, positions).

Question 2
Methods of Including CSS:
Inline Styles: Directly apply styles to HTML elements using the style attribute.
Internal Styles: Write CSS within <style> tags in the <head> section.
External Styles: Link an external CSS file using the <link> tag for site-wide styling and reusability.

Question 3
Anatomy of a CSS Rule: A CSS rule has a selector (identifies elements) and a declaration block (in {}) containing property-value pairs (property: value;).

Question 4
RGBA vs RGB: Use RGBA to specify color opacity (A for alpha, ranges 0-1), unlike RGB which lacks transparency control.

Question 5
Hex vs RGB: Hex (e.g., #FF0000) and RGB (e.g., rgb(255,0,0)) both represent colors; Hex is a compact form of RGB values.

Question 6
HSL for Color Control: HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) offers intuitive color adjustments, useful for creating color variations and schemes.

Question 7
Primary Text Properties in CSS: Key text properties include color, font-family, font-size, font-weight, text-align, text-decoration, text-transform, line-height, and text-indent.

Question 8
Using vh or vw for Font Size: vh (viewport height) and vw (viewport width) are responsive units, ideal for sizing text relative to screen dimensions.

Question 9
Difference Between em and rem Units: em is relative to its parent's font size, while rem is relative to the root (<html>) font size, ensuring consistent sizing across nested elements.

Question 10
Fallback Font Selection: If multiple fonts are listed in font-family, browsers attempt to use them in order; if one isn't available, it tries the next, ensuring text displays in an available font.
